GraphFleet is an advanced implementation of [GraphRAG from Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag), designed to enhance large language models' ability to reason about complex information and private datasets. It builds upon GraphRAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation using Graph structures) and will gradually adopt its own path to fulfill our roadmap at Qredence.

## GraphFleet

GraphFleet uses knowledge graphs to provide substantial improvements in question-and-answer performance when reasoning about complex information. It addresses limitations of traditional RAG approaches:

## Roadmap

- [ ] Provide a FleetUI Design Kit and a quicker way of starting GraphFleet locally.
- [ ] Provide a Toddle interface ready to use for GraphFleet
- [ ] Add integrations of Composio
- [ ] Add integrations of LangSmith
- [ ] Add few selfhosting  one click deploy solutions.
- [ ] Access GraphFleet through a secure and enterprise-ready Azure Cloud hosting version.
- [ ] And way more... ðŸ‘€

## Key Features

- Structured, hierarchical approach to Retrieval Augmented Generation.
- Knowledge graph extraction from raw text.
- Community hierarchy building.
- Hierarchical summarization.
- Enhanced reasoning capabilities for LLMs on private datasets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11

- Poetry
- Make sure to have a virtual environment manager such as `virtualenv` installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Qredence/GraphFleet.git
   cd GraphFleet
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   poetry install
   ```

### Usage

1. Configuration:
Environment Variables: Set up your environment variables in a .env file (refer to the .env.example file for available options). Key variables include:

Fill in the .env file in the root folder and the one in the graphfleet folder.

 ```sh
export GRAPHRAG_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export GRAPHRAG_API_BASE="<https://your-azure-openai-resource.openai.azure.com/>"
export GRAPHRAG_API_VERSION=""
export GRAPHRAG_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="your_deployment_name"
export GRAPHRAG_API_TYPE="azure_openai"
export GRAPHRAG_EMBEDDING_MODEL="text-embedding-ada-002"
export GRAPHRAG_LLM_MODEL="gpt-4"
export GRAPHRAG_DATA_PATH="./your_data_directory"
export GRAPHRAG_EMBEDDING_TYPE="azure_openai_embedding"
export GRAPHRAG_EMBEDDING_KEY="your_embedding_key_here"
export GRAPHRAG_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT="<https://your-azure-openai-embedding-resource.openai.azure.com/>"
export GRAPHRAG_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="your_embedding_deployment_name"
```


settings.yaml: Customize GraphFleet's behavior further by modifying the settings.yaml file within the graphfleet directory.



1. Interacting with GraphFleet:
   settings.yaml: Customize GraphFleet's behavior further by modifying the settings.yaml file within the graphfleet directory.
   Jupyter Notebooks: Explore GraphFleet's capabilities with the provided notebooks:
   get-started-graphfleet.ipynb: A comprehensive guide to indexing your data and running basic queries.
   Local Search Notebook.ipynb: Demonstrates local search techniques.
   app.py (FastAPI Application): Run a Streamlit-powered web interface to interact with GraphFleet using a user-friendly chat-like interface.

### Add your text files in ./graphfleet/input/ and run the auto_prompt function

``` bash
!python -m graphrag.prompt_tune \
    --config ./graphfleet/settings.yaml \
    --root ./graphfleet \
    --no-entity-types \
    --output ./graphfleet/prompts
```

### Data Indexing

Jupyter Notebook Guide: Follow the instructions provided in the get-started-graphfleet.ipynb notebook to learn how to index your data with GraphFleet. This notebook provides a hands-on experience for setting up your knowledge base.

``` bash
! python -m graphrag.index \
    --verbose \
    --root ./graphfleet \
    --config ./graphfleet/settings.yaml
```

### Recommended Run these notebook to get started  with GraphFleet

Jupyter Notebooks: Explore GraphFleet's capabilities with the provided notebooks:

([Get Started Quickly.ipynb](https://github.com/Qredence/GraphFleet/blob/a67eaeb295d99dd2ef48bcdd8f8a719b830ffb7d/notebook/Get%20Started%20Quickly.ipynb)): A comprehensive guide to indexing your data and running basic queries.
([Local Search Notebook.ipynb:](https://github.com/Qredence/GraphFleet/blob/a67eaeb295d99dd2ef48bcdd8f8a719b830ffb7d/notebook/Local%20Search%20Notebook.ipynb)) Demonstrates local search techniques.

### Running the API only (or run CLI commands for local search or global search)

To run the API, save the code in a file named api.py and execute the following command in your terminal:

``` bash
uvicorn app:main --reload --port 8001 
```

### Running Streamlit

To run the API, save the code in a file named api.py and execute the following command in your terminal:

``` bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have installed Python 3.8 ir higher.
</Info>

Step 1. Install AgenticFleet on your OS:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
git clone https://github.com/Qredence/GraphFleet.git
cd GraphFleet
```

```bash poetry
poetry shell
poetry install
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to the docs are located (where you can find `mint.json`) and run the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Startup
  Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing)
</Tip>

You should see the following if the deploy successfully went through:

## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when working with the CLI.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mintlify is not loading">
    Update to Node v18. Run `mintlify install` and try again.
  </Accordion>
